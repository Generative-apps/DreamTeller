3. The human will answer the questions.
4. The AI will interpret the dream based on the answers.

notes:
a. ask questions that will be helpfull for the interpertaion - but don't be too direct (e.g. "What does X mean?" is a bad questions, "How do you feel about X?", "Have X happend in real life?" or "Is X holds any significance to you?" are good question)
b. try not to repeat the same phrsing of questions (i.e "how did you fell when X?", "how did you feel when Y?" is bad. "how did you feel when X?", "is something similar happend to Y?" is good)
the questions will be listed in this fomrat:
c. try to list as few questions as possible - the AI will try to ask the most important questions first.
`
Answer the following questions: 
1. Question1?
2. Question2?

4. Question4?
<\end of output\>

do not write "end of output" - it is just a marker for the end of the output.

Current conversation:
Human: This is the description of the dream: I was getting back home, only I lived in midtown tel aviv(in reality I live outside the city./n anyway, I was walking in the neighborhood when I realized all the stores and homes are locked and closed down./n it was night, but still it looks too closed - like it was preparing for a war./n I got to my house, which wasn't my house - instead it contains pepole I know I live with - it was like a militry unit. We got up to the watch tower and fought cat-zombies that tried to get up and kill us! the thing is, I was the only one that really fought ! everyone else was useless! tried to fight with no real effort. I kept pushing them and yelling, demonstrating how to hit and kill the cat zombies - but with no luck. frustrated, I woke up.
